## **Scenario**

A large multinational corporation heavily relies on the 3CX software for phone communication, making it a critical component of their business operations. After a recent update to the 3CX Desktop App, antivirus alerts flag sporadic instances of the software being wiped from some workstations while others remain unaffected. Dismissing this as a false positive, the IT team overlooks the alerts, only to notice degraded performance and strange network traffic to unknown servers. Employees report issues with the 3CX app, and the IT security team identifies unusual communication patterns linked to recent software updates.

As the threat intelligence analyst, it's your responsibility to examine this possible supply chain attack. Your objectives are to uncover how the attackers compromised the 3CX app, identify the potential threat actor involved, and assess the overall extent of the incident.

## **What is a Supply Chain Attack?**

A **supply chain attack** is a cunning strategy where an adversary strikes not directly at a target, but instead at the trusted services or software the target relies on. They manipulate or compromise the trusted entities—often software updates, code repositories, or even hardware supply chains. In the case of the **3CX** breach, the attackers exploited the very update mechanism of a trusted app, turning it into a Trojan horse.

The attack is subtle, hidden beneath the veil of trust that companies place in their tools. The victim doesn’t even see the strike coming, and by the time they realize it, the damage is done. Trust is shattered, and the network is compromised. This is the power of a well-executed **supply chain attack**.



## **Who is 3CX?**

**3CX** is a key player in the world of unified communications. They provide software that integrates voice, video, and messaging into a single platform. The **3CX Desktop App** is used by businesses globally for their internal and external communication. It’s trusted by thousands of organizations to maintain seamless communication channels. But what happens when trust is betrayed? What happens when a tool designed to enhance security is turned against you?



## **Unraveling the Attack: The Analysis**

The **attack** began as a whisper. Users began to notice strange anomalies after updating their **3CX Desktop App**. The IT teams couldn’t make sense of it. But the breach was more sophisticated than anyone realized. Enter **Mandiant**—the knights who would sift through the wreckage and expose the truth.

Upon digging deeper, **Mandiant** discovered that the malicious code had been inserted during the **update process** of the **3CX Desktop App**. This wasn't just a simple vulnerability; it was a full-scale operation. **UNC4736**, a notorious North Korean hacker group, was the mastermind behind this attack. The group had gained access to **3CX’s infrastructure** and used their trusted update process as a delivery system for the malware.



## **Details from 3CX’s Official Site**

The **3CX** team, now aware of the breach, published an **official statement** [3CX Supply Chain Attack Details](https://www.3cx.com/blog/news/security-incident-updates/), outlining the incident. They provided a timeline of the attack, starting from the first user complaints to the eventual discovery of the malicious code. Versions of the **3CX Desktop App** prior to **18.12.416** were identified as vulnerable.

This update, initially intended to improve the software, instead opened a backdoor to thousands of organizations using the app. The **3CX** team’s swift action and transparency were crucial in halting the breach, but the damage was already done.



## **The Mandiant Findings: Unveiling the Malice**

The attack was not an isolated incident. **Mandiant**, the cybersecurity experts summoned by **3CX**, conducted a deep analysis that would unearth the hidden origins of the **3CX Supply Chain Attack**. Their findings revealed a carefully orchestrated chain of events—one that demonstrated the full scope of the attackers' sophistication.

According to **Mandiant**, the **initial compromise vector** of **3CX's network** stemmed from **malicious software downloaded from the Trading Technologies website**. This would become the key starting point in a series of cascading events. A **software supply chain attack**, where the very tools meant to enable business operations were weaponized, led to the infection of 3CX’s software. 

The victim in this case? **3CX Desktop App 18.12.416 and earlier versions**. These legitimate versions were **trojanized**—meaning they were embedded with **malicious code**. Upon installation, this trojanized software deployed a **downloader** named **SUDDENICON**, which quietly communicated with **command-and-control (C2) servers**. These servers, which were hidden in **encrypted icon files** hosted on **GitHub**, were a key aspect of the attack. 

The malware would then **decrypt the C2 servers**, enabling further downloads from the attackers. One such malicious payload was a **third-stage** malware known as **ICONICSTEALER**, a sophisticated **dataminer** that stealthily exfiltrated browser information and other sensitive data.

The attackers themselves were traced back to **UNC4736**, a **North Korean** cyber-espionage group. This group, part of a **nexus of activity** linked to **North Korea**, had carefully crafted this attack to infiltrate trusted companies worldwide. 

As the investigation unfolded, Mandiant's report would go on to highlight that this was not just one isolated breach—this was a **supply chain attack** that had its roots in another **software supply chain attack**. A chilling realization that the tools we trust can often be the very channels through which our systems are breached.

  style="max-width:800px; width:100%;">


## **The Connection to Trading Technologies**

As Mandiant uncovered, the **initial compromise** that led to the 3CX supply chain attack originated from a trusted source—**Trading Technologies**, a provider of trading software. The malicious software, which was later found to be infected, was downloaded from their website, setting the stage for the supply chain attack on **3CX**.

According to Mandiant, the **Trading Technologies** website served as the **malicious entry point** for the attack, where the compromised software was hosted. This connection revealed a **deep supply chain vulnerability**, showcasing how an attack could propagate from one trusted entity to another, causing a ripple effect that affected 3CX's operations and beyond.


In total, this event marks an alarming trend of how **supply chain attacks** can unfold—starting with one trusted entity, spreading through legitimate channels, and ultimately compromising significant targets like 3CX.

For further reading on this, refer to the original [Mandiant Blog Post](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/3cx-software-supply-chain-compromise).



As the investigation continued, Mandiant traced the **initial intrusion vector** back to a compromised software package distributed via an earlier software supply chain attack. This attack began with a **tampered installer** for **X_TRADER**, a software package provided by **Trading Technologies**. 

Mandiant determined that the attack unfolded through a **complex loading process** that eventually led to the deployment of **VEILEDSIGNAL**, a **multi-stage modular backdoor**, alongside its various modules. The malware was cleverly designed to infiltrate and spread through **3CX’s network**, eventually reaching a server used for **software development**, where it corrupted a legitimate **3CX installer application**.

#### **How it Happened**
The **X_TRADER** software was not being actively used, yet it could still be downloaded from the **Trading Technologies** website as late as **2022**. Hackers infiltrated this software, signed it with the same digital signature as the legitimate software (set to expire in **October 2022**), and infected it with malicious code.

Once installed on a **3CX employee’s system**, this compromised installer allowed the attackers to **spread their access** across 3CX’s infrastructure, including critical servers. 

The attack was multi-faceted:

1. **Downloader and Command & Control (C2) Servers**: The compromised software contained a downloader that received **encrypted icon files** from **GitHub**, which in turn decrypted **C2 servers**. These servers were used to retrieve further payloads, including the **IconicStealer** dataminer capable of stealing browser information.

2. **Lateral Movement**: The attackers made use of **Fast Reverse Proxy**, a publicly available tool, to move laterally through the **3CX network**, increasing their control.

3. **SIGFLIP and DAVESHELL**: These tools were used to decrypt malicious code that was loaded into the system's memory. Specifically, **SIGFLIP** used an **RC4 stream cipher** to decrypt bad programs and find other malicious modules such as **DAVESHELL**.

4. **Compromising the 3CX Build Environment**: At some point, the attackers successfully compromised the **3CX build environment**, allowing them to tamper with the software development process itself. This move allowed them to inject further malicious code into the production software used by 3CX customers.

In short, the attack was multi-layered and sophisticated, involving several stages of exploitation, encryption, and lateral movement.

For more details on this phase, refer to the [Mandiant Blog](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/3cx-software-supply-chain-compromise).

This was the beginning of a more complex web of intrusions that impacted both **Trading Technologies** and **3CX**, resulting in the eventual compromise of 3CX’s legitimate software that spread to their customers.

## **Breaking Down the Attack**

Now that we've analyzed the scenario and gathered key insights from Mandiant and other sources, let's break down the individual components of the attack.



#### **The Downloader: `SUDDENICON`**

The malware triage analysis of **3CXDesktopApp installer MSI** reveals a fascinating and dangerous multi-step attack. Upon installation, the malicious software waits **seven days** before fetching additional payloads from **GitHub** and establishing **Command and Control (C2)** communication. Two files, **ffmpeg.dll** and **d3dcompiler_47.dll**, were dropped onto the system, with the latter containing the backdoor **SUDDENICON**.

Both of these libraries are commonly used and seem innocuous at first glance, but in this case, they were **backdoored**. It’s critical to understand that these files' names alone shouldn't trigger alarms. The real danger lies in their malicious modification. 

- **SUDDENICON** is a key part of the attack, running a downloader that fetches further malicious payloads. 
- **ffmpeg.dll** and **d3dcompiler_47.dll** are legitimate files, which have been compromised in this case.

  style="max-width:800px; width:100%;">
  

#### **Lateral Movement**

In the **3CX supply chain compromise**, lateral movement was facilitated by several malware families. These helped the attackers expand their foothold within the environment, allowing them to **communicate with C2 servers** and execute additional payloads.

Here are some of the key malware families used:

- **TaxHaul**: Upon execution, this malware decrypts a shellcode payload and persists via **DLL search-order hijacking**.
- **Coldcat**: A downloader that also establishes communication with **C2 infrastructure**.
- **PoolRat**: Used on **macOS systems** to collect system information and execute commands.
- **IconicStealer**: The third stage of the attack, serving as a data miner.

This lateral movement helped the attackers maintain persistence and further infiltrate the network.
