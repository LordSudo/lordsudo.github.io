**Week starting:** 26th January

This week ended up being very busy, which meant I couldn’t find the time to sit the CBTeamer exam as planned. That said, it was still a productive week overall, just in a different way than expected.

## What I worked on
The biggest win this week was that my routine finally fell into place. I managed to carve out dedicated, repeatable time for authoring challenges, which made a noticeable difference.

During that time, I authored **two OSINT challenges** for an upcoming CTF. They were genuinely fun to build and felt good from a design and learning perspective.

I also continued making progress on the **Active Directory course**, going deeper into the fundamentals of AD authentication. This pass was much more detailed than surface-level coverage, and it helped connect a lot of concepts that are easy to gloss over.

## Key takeaways
Having a stable routine matters more than trying to force individual goals into a chaotic week. Even without sitting the exam, meaningful progress happened once time was intentionally blocked out.

The AD content is also shaping up to be something worth writing about — I might put together a separate blog post on it later.

## Challenges and friction
The main challenge this week was time. Between work and other commitments, there wasn’t enough uninterrupted space to fit in an exam on top of everything else.

## Looking ahead
With the routine now feeling more natural, next week will be about sticking to it and building on the momentum.

Focus for next week:
- Continue the AD course  
- Keep authoring and refining CTF challenges  
- Revisit the CBTeamer exam when time allows  

*Settling back into a rhythm — more progress to come.*
