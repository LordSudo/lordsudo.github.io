**Week starting:** 2nd February

This week was a mix of creating, experimenting, and planning ahead.

## What I worked on
I authored a few more challenges for an **international CTF** scheduled to run around mid of February. Most of the work here was focused on refining ideas and making sure the challenges are both fun and fair.

I also spent some time playing around with **Claude Skills**, mainly out of curiosity. I ended up comparing outputs between GPT Go, Claude Free, and a few custom GPTs. AI tooling is genuinely fun to experiment with… although it’s also very easy to see how it can get expensive.

On the learning side, I started studying **cloud security**, with a particular focus on **Azure**, as part of my certification plans for the year.

## Key takeaways
AI experimentation feels most useful when it’s tied to a real workflow. The next step here is figuring out how to set up an LLM that can interface with my Obsidian notes in a way that’s actually practical.

It also feels good to start laying groundwork for skills I know I’ll need later in the year, rather than cramming them last minute.

## Challenges and friction
There was a lot of context switching this week — between authoring, experimenting, studying, and general admin work — which made focus harder at times.

## Other updates
- Started working on ideas for a few sessions I’ll be delivering later in the year  
- Took care of some extra work for a project I’m currently building (more on that soon)

## Looking ahead
Next week will be about tightening focus and turning some of this exploration into more concrete progress.

*Laying more groundwork for what’s coming next.*
