**Week starting:** 9th February 2026

This was a productive week with a good mix of content creation, learning, and real-world CTF authoring experience.

## What I worked on

**Content:**
- Published two blog posts:
  - "The Best Labs Are the Broken Ones"
  - "The Problem with 'Just Google It' (And Now, 'Just Ask AI')"

**Site Work:**
- Configured Google Analytics on the blog (just for fun) Took inspiration from 0xdf

**Learning:**
- Attended a HTB meetup session covering a Season 10 machine
- Made solid progress on the Active Directory course, specifically diving into **Unauthenticated Enumeration**
- Worked through several Sherlocks on HTB to keep defensive skills sharp

**CTF Authoring:**
- My OSINT challenge for **0xfun CTF** went live this weekend
  - 17 solves over 48 hours
  - Feedback was mostly positive (though some players had... *strong opinions* about the difficulty)
- Currently focused on authoring challenges for another CTF happening next weekend

## Key takeaways

The OSINT challenge experience was valuable. Watching players solve it in real-time, seeing their approaches, and reading the feedback; both the constructive and the "I wanted to finish you" variety, gave me insight into how difficulty is perceived vs. intended.

The AD course content on unauthenticated enumeration is connecting a lot of dots. Understanding what attackers can learn *before* credentials makes the defensive side much more interesting as I try and trace the trails of those activities.

Publishing two blogs in one week felt good. The rhythm is settling in.

## Challenges and friction

Balancing CTF authoring deadlines with learning and content creation required some juggling. The week was busy, but manageable with the routine now in place.

## Looking ahead

Next week's focus:
- Finalize challenges for another upcoming CTF (next weekend)
- Continue the AD course
- Possibly start drafting another blog post (got a few ideas in place)
- Work on 0xfun Osint Challenge Writeup

*Building, learning, and shipping; week 5 done.*
